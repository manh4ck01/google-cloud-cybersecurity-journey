# 08 - MIXED/EXTRA LABS

> “Experiment, integrate, and innovate — the best learning happens at the intersections.”
---

## 🌩️ Overview

- This module contains supplemental labs and exercises that combine or extend previous modules, including:

- Cross-module integrations (IAM + Networking + Cloud Armor)

- Experimental security configurations

- Sandbox simulations of real-world attacks and defenses

- Automation experiments with scripts and policies

- It’s designed to showcase my ability to apply multiple GCP security concepts together and think like a practical cloud security engineer.

---

## 🧩 Learning Objectives

- Apply knowledge from multiple modules in unified labs

- Test and experiment with advanced configurations safely

- Understand interdependencies between IAM, networking, and security services

- Build small proof-of-concept security projects

- Document insights, pitfalls, and best practices for real-world scenarios

---

## 🔧 Hands-On Labs / Exercises

- Combine IAM roles with network segmentation and firewall policies

- Apply Cloud Armor rules to multiple web applications

- Simulate threat detection with Security Command Center

- Test logging and monitoring dashboards for end-to-end coverage

- Create mini-projects integrating Terraform or scripts for automation

--- 

## 📘 Key Concepts

- Cross-Service Integration: IAM + Networking + SCC + Cloud Armor

- Sandbox Testing: Safe experimentation for security configurations

- Automation: Scripts, Terraform templates, and deployment policies

- Real-World Scenarios: Simulating attacks and mitigation strategies
