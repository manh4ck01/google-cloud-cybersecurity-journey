## 📘 Module 1: Introduction to the Cloud

### The Cloud’s Impact
**Ben’s Story:** Education and businesses are transforming through cloud adoption — offering scalability, accessibility, and innovation.

### Composition of the Cloud
Cloud systems consist of:
- **Compute resources** (VMs, containers)
- **Storage**
- **Networking**
- **Security layers**

---

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment Models
1. **Public Cloud** – Shared infrastructure (e.g., Google Cloud Platform)
2. **Private Cloud** – Dedicated infrastructure for one organization
3. **Hybrid Cloud** – Combination of public and private
4. **Multi-Cloud** – Using multiple cloud providers strategically

---

## 🔒 Google’s Trusted Infrastructure
- Global network with **redundancy and reliability**
- **Zero Trust** security model
- **Encryption at rest and in transit**
- **Compliance certifications** (ISO, SOC, GDPR)

---

## ⚖️ Cloud Benefits and Considerations
### Benefits
- **Scalability** – On-demand resources
- **Cost efficiency** – Pay-as-you-go
- **Resilience** – High availability across data centers

### Limitations
- **Shared responsibility model**
- **Dependency on provider uptime**
- **Data residency concerns**

---

## 💡 Ephemerality and Cloud Resources
- Cloud resources are **temporary and replaceable**.
- Use automation to manage short-lived compute instances.
- Encourages **immutable infrastructure** principles.

---

## 💻 Compute in the Cloud

### Virtualization and Virtual Machines (VMs)
- One physical server can host **multiple virtual instances**.
- Managed using **Compute Engine** in GCP.

### Serverless Computing
- Run code without managing servers.
- Examples: **Cloud Functions**, **Cloud Run**
- Best for **event-driven applications**.

### Containerization
- Package apps with dependencies.
- Managed via **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**.
- Enables **microservice architectures**.

---

## 🗄️ Cloud Storage Concepts

### Cloud Storage Benefits
- Highly available and durable
- Scalable capacity
- Integrated security and access management

### Types of Cloud Storage
1. **Object Storage** – Unstructured data (e.g., images, logs)
2. **Block Storage** – Raw storage volumes for VMs
3. **File Storage** – Shared file systems

### Google’s Storage Options
- **Cloud Storage (GCS)** – Object storage
- **Persistent Disk** – Block storage for Compute Engine
- **Filestore** – Managed NFS file server

---

## 🧩 Key Takeaways
- The **cloud** provides scalability, security, and flexibility.
- **Google Cloud** emphasizes a trusted infrastructure built on zero trust.
- **Compute, storage, and deployment models** are core to understanding cloud operations.
- Ephemerality and automation are essential for modern cloud security and efficiency.

---

## ✅ Next Steps
- Review “**Security in the Cloud**” (next module).
- Practice labs on **IAM**, **Compute Engine**, and **Storage**.
- Document all configurations and findings for portfolio use.
